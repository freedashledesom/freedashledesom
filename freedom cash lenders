EarnIn objects to the characterization of its product as a loan or cash advance in part because it doesn’t pursue borrowers who don’t repay them, as lenders often do. The app says it offers “access to earned wages.” But consumer advocates say that, like lenders, cash advance apps act as intermediaries that provide cash and take it back on the following payday.

An analysis by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) of more than 5.8 million transactions across three tip-based apps in 2021 showed that users added tips on over 70% of transactions.

That may be, in part, because of how apps request tips, says Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

An app may set a default tip amount or show recommended percentages like your local coffee shop does. The screen may include a message about tips helping to keep the app in business or providing advances to more users.
